Your task is to assign movie recomendations using kNN method applied for each person separately. To use this approach both feature vector (representation) of the movies must by generated and similarity measure for those vectors must be defined. The features can be automaticaly extracted using API for TMDB database. As a result you should submit the following files:

submission.csv
features.txt
similarity.txt
The submission.csv file should correspond with task.csv but all the NULL values should be replaced by predicted movie evaluation values. The features.txt and similarity.txt should contain short but clear description of extracted features and proposed similarity measure, respectively.

The solution must be submitted as a single zip file which directly (without any unnecessary directory) contains expected deliverables.

It should be assumed that all text files contain an empty line at the end of the file and that the Unix encoding of the end of line character is used.

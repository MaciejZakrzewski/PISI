The similarity measure is as follows:
    1. Pick person from task.csv
    2. Compare his films ratings from train.csv with other people ratings
        (count the absolute difference of ratings, if there is no rating for compared person -> add "5" which is the biggest possible distance between ratings)
    3. Sort (the smaller distance, the better)
